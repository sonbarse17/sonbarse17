# Hello, I'm Sushant Sonbarse ! 👋

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** passionate about automating infrastructure, improving CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring seamless collaboration between development and operations teams. I specialize in creating scalable and reliable systems that can handle high volumes of traffic and data.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, CloudFormation, 
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **Scripting**: Bash, Python, Go
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB 
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Amzon Linux 2)


## 🔥 DevOps Projects & Contributions

I am always exploring ways to improve system reliability and automation. Here are some of my projects:

- [**Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Setup**](Link-to-Project) - Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker, automating testing, building, and deployment processes.
- [**Project 2: Infrastructure Automation**](Link-to-Project) - Deployed infrastructure with Terraform and AWS, enabling automated provisioning and management of cloud resources.
- [**Project 3: Kubernetes Cluster Setup**](Link-to-Project) - Set up a Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts for scalable microservices architecture.
- [**Project 4: Monitoring & Alerts**](Link-to-Project) - Configured Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and real-time alerts.
